# OA_VirtOffice_Project_Code
This is the starting basis to make a virtual web office for employers and coworkers to join remotely but have the in-office feeling.

The purpose of this project is to provide a digital platform for remote workers that focuses on the benefits of remote work while addressing the challenges known in this work model Remote work eliminates the need to commute, fosters a more flexible schedule, and can potentially enhance work-life balance.

For managers, the benefits lie in reduces office expenses and lower humand spending but they face the challenge of ensuring employee productivity in a remote setting. The virtual web office aims to navigate and optimize they dynamics for a better remote work experience.

        You'll see 2 directories: client and server

2. Go to the server directory
    `cd server`

3. Install all dependencies
    `npm install`

4. Go to the server source directory

    - Go to your local directory in your terminal

7. Go to the client directory
    `cd client`

8. Install all dependencies
    `npm install`

9. Build frontend code
    `npm run-script build`

        You can ignore the warnings. If it builds successfully, you should see *"The build folder is ready to be deployed"* towards the end

10. Start your frontend server
    `serve -s build` or `npx serve -s build`

11. Open a browser window and go to http://localhost:3000/

12. You should see a map with a character in the middle
